Hi everyone, I'm Benjamin Berhault. I've been working for the Paris Fire Brigade for 14 years now - first as a fire fighter and paramedic for 7 years, from simple fire fighter to watch manager, and I loved it, really loved it. <br>
<br>
But then at some point I had to help in a different way, so I decided to go back to school, to get a master degree.<br>
Still working for the Paris Fire Brigade, I'm now an IT person, Data programmer/analyst.<br>
<br>
I still contribute in helping people but in a different way, from behind the scene, providing to managers meaningful information extracted from data produced by different systems used.<br>
<br>
The reason why Jackson Szabo asked me to come and talk in front of you today is related to some work I've realised leading to a way to increase the effectiveness of emergency services.<br>
<br>
So let's talk about efficiency.

What is the basis of an emergency service's effectiveness? <br> 
<br>

				<section data-state="bottom_left_info" data-transition="slide-in slide-out">

					<aside class="notes">
And with thousands of daily calls, most of which are not what we define as an emergency, the challenge relief services are facing is to maintain enough units to respond to potential future critical demands. <br>
<br>
But how are operators doing this? How do they decide to send a team over another estimated as being faster to get to the scene in order to maintain a good quality of service for future requests? <br>
<br>
It seems that all our current allocation systems present more or less lack of information so that operators can’t actually make an optimal allocation decision. <br>
<br>
Currently, a call processing operator is sending a rescue team using the following information:
					</aside>
				</section>
				
				<section data-state="bottom_left_info" data-transition="slide-in slide-out">
					<ul>
						<li class="fragment" style="height: 60px;">Nature of the emergency </li>
						<li class="fragment" style="height: 60px;">Location of the request </li>
						<li class="fragment" style="height: 60px;">Estimated time of transportation of the team </li>
					</ul>
					<aside class="notes">
<ul>
<li> It assesses the severity of the request and whether or not an emergency team has to be sent, <font color = "blue"> <b> [next] </b> </font>usually based on a decision support tree</li>
<li> if needed, he can visualize the location of the demand on a map <font color = "blue"> <b> [next] </b> </font> </li>
<li> finally, the system proposes various allocation options with estimated delivery times for the different teams <font color = "blue"> <b> [next] </b> </font> </li>
</ul>
Do you think that with this information, it is easy for allocators to decide which team is the optimal one? Yes? No? <br> <br>
Let's see..

						<aside class="notes">
So, indeed, it is a difficult decision. <br> <br>
And why is it difficult? ... let's take an example ... with the following call ... <br>
<font color = "blue"> <b> [next] </b> </font> Is it difficult to choose whether or not to allocate a team, and which one to allocate? <font color = "blue"> <b> [play] </b> </font>

					<aside class="notes">
For this case it's obvious, just send the fastest one that will be able to arrive on scene. The problem is when some of the cases are not proven to be urgent, and allocating a team can potentially strip an area of future requests truly critical<br>
					<br>
That's the problem. <br>

					<aside class="notes">

Current systems do not specify to the operators, the consequence of their allocation decision. They do not show them the resulting coverage of the population at the time of the dispatch decision. They do not show them the population percentage covered below the threshold of quality of service.

<font color="blue"><b>[Wait few seconds]</b></font>
<br> <br>
Before going further I need you to have in mind 2 important concepts of operations management for emergency services.<br>
To effectively manage an emergency service the concept of coverage of the population is important ..., and we can split it into 2 types:<br> 
<ul>
	<li>The immediate response relying on: How long will it take for a first team to reach a location? </li>
	<li>And the response capacity: How many teams can be on site within a given timeframe? (for example, the target timeframe for London Ambulance Service is 8 minutes)</li>
</ul>
The latter is the most important and you will have a representation of it on the next slide. 
<br> <br>
With those notions in mind, let's see what might look like an effective dispatch application.
<br> <br>

For this demonstration, let's say that we are about to send a team for a non-critical request while the operational coverage is suffering due to a strong demand of relief, leading to 30% of the units remaining available.<br>
<br>
<font color="blue"><b>[next]</b></font>This application has been setup to recover the first 3 fastest units (this is of course just a parameter modifiable, if needed). 
<br>
The allocation options are now presented with 2 maps: <br>
<ul>
<li> one showing the response capacity before allocation, at the top</li>
<li> and after allocation for the bottom one</li>
</ul>
The ambulances are represented by blue points of interest and the request by a red one. 
<br>
For the road segments, red means that those segments are not reachable by a team under the 8 minutes quality of service threshold. For those reachable by 1 to 5 teams they are assigned a color from yellow to green, green if 5 teams are able to reach them under 8 minutes. 
<br>
Cartographic representations are really great for quickly assessing the service situation,  <br>
<br>
But in some cases, things may not be so obvious, so for that, each allocation option is associated with an estimate of the population covered under 8 minutes.  <br>
<br>
Even if the interface could have been more exhaustive, I hope it’s made it obvious the benefits of such information in a dispatch application.  <br>
<br>
I hope I'm not the only one who finds that this is not a gadget but that this tool has a real interest in improving the quality of service for an emergency service.<br>
And do not see this as an end in itself, but as a brick needed and suitable for outstanding future applications that will increase the capacity of the emergency services in terms of control of their coverage and responsiveness. <br>

Because after being able to assess more accurately the transit of the rescue units, the current coverage and after dispatch. <br> <br>

Well ... It seems to me that any responsible, responsive and dedicated professional of an emergency service will have in mind to push the possibilities offered by geographic information systems further with the indoor mapping.  <br> <br>
The exploitation of the internal cartography will be incredible for the emergency services if they really invest in it. The centres of management and coordination will no longer have to envy the management rooms of the Hollywood super productions ... <br>
The next revolution of the control of emergency operations will not be the ability to predict <font color = "blue"> <b> [next] </b> </font> where an emergency call will take place, with 3 mediums floating in a pool as in the movie minority report. <br> <br>

No..

The revolution that we could benefit from, if we really invest in it, is to implement and take advantage of the possibilities offered by the indoor mapping. <br>
Decision makers should really fight for it. 
<br> <br>
But let's start with the beginning, a real control of our road network, dispatch, and a true mastery of the operational coverage is a necessary first step to achieve before going further. <br> <br>

A lot of good thing, amazing thing are achievable, a true control and vision for managers of their units is possible, but for that: investments, qualified people and a lot of work are needed. <br> <br>
